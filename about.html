<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Brazilian living in Ireland for 4 years. I used to be a Sushi Chef in a restaurant located in Galway, Ireland. Even though I enjoyed making Sushi for my lovely customers I discovered myself wanting to learn more about technology and what it has to offer. I am currently studying Web Development in Udemy (The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu) and this is my first html file!</p>

<p>I am an organised and detail-oriented professional, always concerned in developing projects with quality envisioning the best results. I am also a fast learner and always work hard to make a difference. I work well on my own or as part of a team.</p>
